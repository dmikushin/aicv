## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

I work at the intersection of research and industrial programming (C/C++, Fortran, Python), where classical supercomputing (MPI, OpenMP) meets modern hardware (GPUs, TPUs, embedded ASICs) and performance optimization.

As co-founder of Purple Gaze Inc., I've developed eyetracking systems that are both more affordable and faster than many existing solutions.

My academic work culminated in earning a PhD from the University of Lausanne, where I developed specialized supercomputing software for economics and finance applications.

My expertise in CUDA, OpenCL, OpenACC, and Machine Learning has established me as an effective consultant in these fields.

I provide effective GPU-accelerated solutions to organizations facing complex computational challenges. My skills help teams successfully port legacy algorithms to utilize NVIDIA H100/GH200 GPU architectures, implement memory-optimized algorithms for better compute-memory balance, and develop portable cross-platform solutions that work reliably across different computing environments.

As a regular user of AI-assisted development tools, I incorporate LLMs into my daily workflow to improve productivity and solve technical challenges more efficiently.
