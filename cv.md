## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

I work at the intersection of research and industrial programming (C/C++, Fortran, Python), where classical supercomputing (MPI, OpenMP) meets modern hardware (GPUs, TPUs, embedded ASICs) and performance optimization. As co-founder of Purple Gaze Inc., I've developed eyetracking systems that are both more affordable and faster than many existing solutions. My expertise in CUDA, OpenCL, OpenACC, and Machine Learning has established me as an effective consultant in these fields. My academic work culminated in earning a PhD from the University of Lausanne, where I developed specialized supercomputing software for economics and finance applications.

I provide effective GPU-accelerated solutions to organizations facing complex computational challenges. My skills help teams successfully port legacy algorithms to utilize NVIDIA H100/GH200 GPU architectures, implement memory-optimized algorithms for better compute-memory balance, and develop portable cross-platform solutions that work reliably across different computing environments.

As a regular user of AI-assisted development tools, I incorporate LLMs into my daily workflow to improve productivity and solve technical challenges more efficiently.


## KEY ACHIEVEMENTS

- **GPU-Accelerated Algorithms Design**: Designed and developed many GPU algorithms in various domains, ranging from economics, computer vision to radio astronomy
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Ported many research and production softwares to any OS, architecture or platform
- **Research Recognition**: Co-authored many research papers and industrial presentations in HPC and CV
- **Entrepreneurship**: Co-founded Purple Gaze Inc. and developed company's first "Foxy" eyetracking device product
