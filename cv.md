## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
You can always find me where research and industrial programming (C/C++ Fortran, Python) and classical supercomputing (MPI, OpenMP) meets modern hardware (GPUs, TPUs, embedded ASICs) and performance optimization (algorithms, profiling, vectorization, etc.). I co-founded Purple Gaze Inc. to show how inexpensive and fast eyetracking systems can be. I enjoy occasional consulting in CUDA, OpenCL, OpenACC and Machine Learning. I earned my PhD from the University of Lausanne by programming supercomputing software for economics and finance.

**Currently seeking a full-time remote position from Switzerland** (work permit already in place), bringing expertise in GPU-accelerated CFD development to organizations facing challenging computational problems. My skills can help teams optimize memory footprint for larger simulations, port existing solvers to leverage NVIDIA H100/GH200 GPUs, implement specialized algorithms for compute-memory balance, and create portable solutions that work across platforms. As an active daily user of LLMs for code development, I leverage these AI tools to enhance productivity and problem-solving.

## KEY ACHIEVEMENTS

- **GPU-Accelerated CFD**: Developed unstructured solver that achieved 15% performance improvement on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU compared to 384 CPU threads on 4× AMD EPYC 7763 CPUs for 50M+ element CFD simulations
- **Memory Optimization**: Implemented reduced-memory multicolor Gauss-Seidel method using Fréchet derivative to achieve 45% memory reduction
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Created portable OpenMP code working efficiently in both multicore and GPU offload scenarios
- **Advanced Architecture Support**: Enabled GH200 support via porting code to ARM64 with Clang
- **Research Recognition**: Co-authored many research papers and industrial presentations in HPC and CV
- **Entrepreneurship**: Co-founded Purple Gaze Inc. and developed company's first "Foxy" eyetracking device product

## CORE COMPETENCIES

- **HPC/Engineering**: Fluency in full development & support cycle of HPC applications for Linux clusters: programming, parallelization for different architectures, debugging, profiling. Experienced in developing and bugfixing very large codebases, such as MSC Nastran, PyTorch, MIOpen, etc.

- **GPU Acceleration Expert**: Specialized in optimizing memory footprint for large-scale simulations, porting existing solvers to leverage NVIDIA H100/GH200 GPUs, and implementing specialized algorithms for optimal compute-memory balance.

- **Research & Development**: Exploring new environments/software and teaching others to use them, designing & performing experiments to analyze hardware/software properties and generalizing findings into practically useful methods/tools.

- **AI-Enhanced Development**: Active daily practitioner of LLM-assisted coding workflows, leveraging AI tools (shell_gpt, VSCode Agent) to accelerate development, debug complex code, and solve technical challenges.

- **Embedded SW/HW**: Developer of embedded machine vision SW/HW. Designed and implemented Linux firmware, realtime processing services for resource-limited ARM processors (eyetracking), realtime device-host communication.

- **Compilers Development**: Knowledge of compiler internal structures, contributions to LLVM. Designed and developed KernelGen - a prototype of auto-parallelizing Fortran/C compiler for NVIDIA GPUs.
